A simple version of an algorithm connecting two off-the-shelf models for cell division and metabolism in yeast.

### Getting started
Didn't have time yet to figure out all the dependencies and configure the repo so that it can be cloned and used easily. I think though if you have jupyter, install the requirements listed below, and run the notebook using a python 2.7 kernell it should work!

### Prerequisites

Run the ipython notebook in Jupyter
Python 2.7

Packages (all available using pip install)

- BooleanNet
- libsbml
- cobra\n
- matplotlib\n
- pandas\n
