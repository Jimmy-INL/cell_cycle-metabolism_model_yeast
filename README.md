# cell_cycle-metabolism_model_yeast
A multi-scale integrative model for the yeast cell division cycle and metabolism
This is a simple version of an algorithm connecting two off-the-shelf models for cell division and metabolism in yeast.


### Getting started
Launch the interactive notebook using the binder badge!

Allthough everything should work if you clone and run in a jupyter notebook / python 2.7 environment with the required packages, the mybinder is a lot faster. It remotely host the interactive notebook and install the required packages.

### Prerequisites

Run the ipython notebook in Jupyter
Python 2.7

Packages (all available using pip install)

- BooleanNet
- libsbml
- cobra
- matplotlib
- pandas
